# SmartBot
This is designed to rewrite the library used to control the Dobot AI-Starter Robot to give students better control of the commands and sensors.

## Introduction
After using the DoBot AI-Starter Kit in my classroom I noticed that the way the Library was created, it was hard to use for students.  The couple of problems that we encountered:

- Library Commands were too long to type out and students made mistakes when typing the long code.
- Students did not have easy control of the individual components such as the individual motors.
- Control of the sensors seems to have some issues.
